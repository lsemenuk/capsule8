// Report pid, tgid, and startTime for a task, ensuring that the task has

// own scheduler, which is great and all, but it makes this a little trickier.
// Luckily the runtime provides functions to lock goroutines (G) to kernel
// tasks (M), and when the Go scheduler runs out of tasks (M) to run goroutines
// (G), it creates more tasks (M). So we just keep forcing new goroutines to be
// created while locking them to a task until we get a goroutine that has
// different pid and tgid, at which point we use proc.FileSystem.TaskStartTime
// to get the task's start time, which also triggers the kprobe that has been
// installed to get the same information from task struct using the offsets
// that we are trying to verify.
//
// This code is clearly abusive, but it saves us the need to execute an
// external program written in C that does the whole thing much more easily.
// Unfortunately doing that introduces whole bunches of security issues and
// other complications.
